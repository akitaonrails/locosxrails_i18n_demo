h1. Ruby I18n gem

I18n and localization solution for Ruby.

For information please refer to http://rails-i18n.org

h2. Fast backend

This fork includes a @Fast@ backend that optimizes for the most common lookups and makes them about 20x (for @t(:'foo.bar.baz')@) or 6x (for @t(:'foo.bar.baz', :a=>'A', :b=>'B')@) times faster than the original @Simple@ backend. The @Fast@ backend is slightly less memory efficient and is slower to @reload!@, but should be a great choice for production environment.

h3. Usage

Clone the repo as a plugin into your Rails app.

<pre>
  # in initializer or enviroment.rb
  I18n.backend = I18n::Backend::Fast.new
</pre>
